#  React Tests
 In this repository ,I show how we can carry out tests on our
 React components using jest matchers and the React testing library
 matchers.so if you are used to jest,you'll be finding some of the
 matchers used in jest here and also some matchers from the react testing
 library.such as `toBeInTheDocument()` , `toHaveTextContent()` e.t.c
 You will also be finding some methods from the React testing library 
 used very often,methods like render,act and fireEvent.
